Distribution:   FILE-COPY,   NSW-CANCER-REGISTRY
CLINICAL:
Right sentinel node.  Right mastectomy for lobular breast ca.  Short stitch superior margin.  Long stitch lateral margin.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right sentinel node biopsy" consists of threepieces of fibrofatty tissue 12, 20 and 30 mm in maximum dimension.  There are three lymph nodes found:  5 x 3 x 3mm, 4 x 4 x 4mm, 5 x 4 x 4mm.  Imprints for Pap and H & E.  Note by [DOCTOR] on the [DATE] at 1740.
Blocks:  1 to 3 - each one lymph node.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No malignant cells.
Result to Dr [DOCTOR] by Dr [DOCTOR]/[DOCTOR] at 5:58pm on the [DATE].  No malignant cells identified on all three lymph nodes.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast" consists of a mastectomy specimen measuring 210 (lateral to medial) x 155 (superior to inferior) x30mm (superficial to deep).  There are two marking stitches as described.  The overlying skin is 155 x 60mm bearing a prominent nipple 15mm in maximum dimension.  The skin surface appears unremarkable.  Superficial margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  At 9 o'clock 12mm from the nipple there is an indurated pale solid tumour measuring 55x 32 x 20mm.  The tumour is 12mm from deep margin, 40mm from inferior, 70mm from superior, 45mm from lateral and 70mm from medial margin. The tumour is 5mm from overlying skin.
Blocks:  1 - section of tumour(ER, PR, Her-2, Ki 67 requested); 2 & 3 - paired sections tumour in relation to overlying skin (block 2 reserved block); 4 - section of tumour; 5 - deep margin closest to tumour; 7 - ?tumour; 8 - section of nipple; 9 - tissue behind nipple; 10 - random section upper outer quadrant; 11 - section of pale area 12mm lateral to the tumour (9 to 10 o'clock); 12 & 13 - random sections lower outer quadrant; 14 & 15 - random sections lower inner quadrant; 16 & 17 - random sections upper inner quadrant.  Please see the diagram.  (TO: [DOCTOR]; [DOCTOR]/rt [DATE])
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A. Isolated tumour cells (approximately 20 cells, <0.2mm across) are present in two out of three lymph nodes identified.
B. Sections show a 55mm invasive ductal carcinoma, Grade 2 with a lobular-like pattern of infiltration (e-cadherin positive). A synoptic report follows.
Invasive carcinoma:
Site: Right breast, 9 o'clock 12mm from nipple
Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma
Invasive tumour size: 55mm
Grade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 2
Tubules: 3     Nuclei: 2     Mitoses: 2     Mitotic rate:   10/10hpf.
Lymphovascular invasion: Present (Block [IDNUM]).
	    
DCIS component:  
DCIS: Presentextent of DCIS: 2.5mm
Nuclear grade: 2
Architecture: Cribriform
Necrosis: Present  
Calcification: Not identified
Degree of DCIS in tumour: 100%
DCIS in adjacent tissue: Not identified
Excision Margins:  
Invasive component: All margins >10mm clear.
In-situ component: All margins >10mm clear.
Receptors (Block [IDNUM]): 
ER:  Positive
	90% of nuclei stained
	predominant intensity of staining: Strong
PR:  Negative 
HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 3+
HER2 SISH:  Performed at [DEPARTMENT], [HOSPITAL] Hospital, see separate report.
Ki-67 index: 20%
e-cadherin: Positive
Nipple: No evidence of malignancy.
LCIS / ALH: Not identified.  
Miscellaneous: The remainder of the breast shows a spectrum of proliferative changes including usual ductal hyperplasia, columnar cell change and apocrine metaplasia.
DIAGNOSIS:
A. Right sentinel node biopsy
- ISOLATED TUMOUR CELLS SEEN IN TWO OUT OF THREE LYMPH NODES
B. Right breast
- 55MM INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA, GRADE 2
- ER POSITIVE, PR NEGATIVE, HER 2 POSITIVE, KI-67 20%
