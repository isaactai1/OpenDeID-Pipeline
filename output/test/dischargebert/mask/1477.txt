C.  Specimen labelled "Uterus and cervix", consists of a uterus withattached cervix weighing 161g in total.  The uterus measures 100 x 70 x 60mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 50 x 50mm and has a nodular tumour arising from it.  The anterior cervix has a piece of vaginal cuff measuring 55 x 20mm attached while the posterior uterus has a further area of vaginal cuff measuring 75 x 24mm attached.  In the posterior uterus there is a cream tumour occupying the cervix and the lower segment measuring 60 x 55mm which comes to within 23mm of the vaginal cuff margin.  Anteriorly there is a similar cream tumour occupying the cervix in the lower segment measuring 50 x 28mm which comes to within 12mm of the vaginal cuff margin.  Anteriorly the tumour appears to invade to a maximum depth of 19mm over a maximum wallthickness of 20mm and posteriorly the tumour appears to abut the serosal surface and invade to the entire wall thickness of 30mm.  The remainder of the myometrium appears unremarkable. Block 1 & 2 - vaginal cuff anteriorly; 3-6 - vaginal cuff posteriorly; 7-10 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 11-16 - full LS of posterior body and cervix (paired blocks 11 & 12, 13 & 14); 17- further tumour anteriorly to deepest point of invasion; 18-20 - further posterior tumour at deepest point of invasion; 21 - reserve block.  Please refer to attached diagram.

MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]) 
A. Sections show 2 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy. A small Mullerian inclusion cyst is present.
B. Sections show 4 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy. A small Mullerian inclusion cyst is present.
C. Sections show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, invading through the full thickness of the posterior wall of the cervix.  The lesion involves the surface peritoneum in the pouch of Douglas over a 1.8 mm area.  Invasion into the parametrium is also present. CIN3 with HPV effect is seen. 
The endometrium is in proliferative phase.
SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA PROFORMA
Grade: Moderately differentiated (G2)
Maximum tumour dimension: 50mm (along cervical canal)
Extent of invasion:  Invasion through full thickness of posterior cervix, with involvement of surface peritoneum lining pouch of Douglas over a 1.8mm area, plus focal invasion into parametrium ([IDNUM], 20, shown to Dr [DOCTOR])
Depth of stromal invasion: 17 mm out of 17 mm ([IDNUM])
Lymphovascular invasion:  Present (single focus, [IDNUM])
Perineural spread: Not seen
Invasive carcinoma margins:
 Parametrial (deep radial): 1mm ([IDNUM])
 Vaginal mucosa: 12mm
CIN 3 margins: 12mm
D. Sections show fat with fibrous adhesions. There is no evidence malignancy.
E. Sections show a benign serous cystadenoma of the ovary.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F. Sections show 5 lymph nodes with no evidence of malignancy.
G. Sections show 5 lymph nodes withno evidence of malignancy.

TISSUE DESCRIPTION
Slides for review: Uterus + cervix + vaginal cuff + parametrium, right ovarian cyst, descending bowel epiploica.

CLINICAL INFORMATION
[AGE] year old cervical cancer. Nodes +ve on PET scan. SCC cervix. Modified radical hysterectomy.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
Eighty (80) x H&Estained slides labelled "[IDNUM] BRATUSA KALA" received courtesy of Dr [DOCTOR], [DEPARTMENT], Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick. Requested by A/Prof [DOCTOR] for review at the Gynaecological Oncology Tumour Board meeting on [CITY] 25 Sept 2013.
Macro Description by: Sharma, Raghwa
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION
A. Sections of the 'left pelvic lymph node" show 2 lymph nodes with reactive changes and focus of endosalpingiosis (mullerian inclusion cyst). There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
B. The sections of the "right pelvic lymph node" show 4lymph nodes with reactive changes and focus of endosalpingiosis. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
C. Specimen labelled "uterus and cervix".  The cervix contains moderately differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma measuring 50mm in linear dimension and invades through the full thickness of the posterior cervix with involvement of the pouch of Douglas peritoneum and the parametrium over 1.8mm.
The squamous cell carcinoma arises from the transformation zone and has adjacent severe dysplasia (CIN3). The squamous cell carcinoma comprises variable sized nests, solid sheets and single infiltrating cells invading through the cervical stroma with foci of lymphovascular invasion. Proximally the squamous cell carcinoma extends up to the junction of the lower uterine segment and the endocervix. Inferiorly the squamous cell carcinoma and CIN3 is situated 12mm from the vaginal cuff margin.
The posterior cervical stroma is at least 17mm thick and the carcinoma invades through it (17/17mm). 
The endometrium is proliferative phase and shows no malignancy.
D. Section labelled "bowel epiploica" contains fatty tissue. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
E. Specimenlabelled "right ovarian contents" is a simple serous cyst and a follicle cyst. There is no atypia or malignancy.
F. Specimen labelled "left external iliac lymph nodes" show 5 lymph nodes with reactive changes. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
G. Specimen labelled "left obturator lymph nodes" contain 5 lymph nodes with reactive changes. There is no eviden of metastatic carcinoma.
H. Specimen labelled "right external iliac lymph nodes" contains 6 lymph nodes with reactive changes. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
I. Specimen labelled "right obturator lymph nodes" contain 9 reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of metastal carcinoma.
J. Specimen labelled "right common iliac lymph nodes" contain 2 reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
K. Specimen labelled "left common iliac lymph nodes" contain 6 reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma.
DIAGNOSIS

- MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED KERATINISING SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA (50MM) INVADING THROUGH POSTERIOR CERVIX (17/17MM) WITH LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION.
SCC AND VIN3 CLEAR OF VAGINAL CUFF MARGIN.
39 REACTIVE LYMPH NODES.
UTERUS: PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM.
BOWEL EPIPLOICA: NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA. 
RIGHT  OVARIAN CYST: SIMPLE SEROUS AND FOLLICULAR CYSTS.
