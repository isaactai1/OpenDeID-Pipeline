CLINICAL:
Recurrent left parietal intra-axial tumour.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left parietal tumour" consists of a tiny fragment of haemorrhagic tissue 3mm.  Divided half for smear and half for frozen section.  
Blocks:  1- frozen section.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
No definite tumour.
Phone result to Dr [DOCTOR] by Dr [DOCTOR] at 2.15pm on [DATE]. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Left parietal lesion" consists of multiple pieces of soft friable tissue measuringin aggregate 5 x 5 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.  (TO: [DOCTOR]  [DOCTOR]/mm [DATE]) 
MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr [DOCTOR]): 
A.  Sections show a piece of cortex and white matter.  No tumour is seen.
B.  Sections show pieces of cortex and white matter.  Most of the tissue is cellular tumour.  The tumour cells have enlarged, atypical pleomorphic nuclei and a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are identified and there is also microvascular proliferation.  The features are of recurrent glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  There are also foci of infarct-like necrosis with hyalinised vessels, consistent with radiotherapy effect but most of the tumour appears viable.   

Immunohistochemical stains: 
GFAP:   Positive. 
IDH1:   To be repeated. 
Ki 67:   Proliferation index around 25%.
CD68:   Highlights numerous macrophages and activated microglial cells.
Molecular tests:
Tissue has been sent to the [HOSPITAL] Institute forassessment of MGMT methylation status.  A supplementary report will be issued.
Block for potential treatment trial (if required):
Viable tumour is best seen in block [IDNUM].


DIAGNOSIS: 
A.  Left parietal tissue:  No tumour.
B.  Left parietal tumour:  Recurrent glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).
