ADDITIONAL REPORT ([DATE])


CLINICAL:
Left insular intra-axial brain tumour.  ? GBM.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left intra-axial brain tumour", consists of a cream/pink piece of solid tissue 12 x 5 x 2mm.  Two smears are prepared.  Half of the remainder for FS in 1 block.  Block 1 - FS; 2 - remainder, AE.    
 
FROZEN SECTION:  High grade glioma. 
Result to Dr [DOCTOR] by Dr [DOCTOR] 2:28pm on [DATE]. 
B.   Specimen labelled "Left intra-axial tumour", consists of fragments of cream and pink coloured solid tissue 25 x 18 x 4mm in aggregate. AE 1 block. 
(TO: [DOCTOR]/ec [DATE]) 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR] and Dr [DOCTOR])
A&B. Sections show highly cellular glial tissue. The majority of the malignant cells have round to oval nuclei with clear cytoplasm. There is moderate to marked cytological atypia. Patchy chicken-wire type vasculature is seen. Foci of palisading necrosis are present. Frequent mitoses are seen in specimen B, estimated to be 10/10 HPF. Microvascular proliferation is not seen. 
Immunohistochemical stains: 
GFAP: predominantly negative
Ki67: 40%
IDH1: -ve
P53 focal positive

Molecular tests: 
Tissue will be sent to Dr [DOCTOR], [HOSPITAL] Cancer Centre for MGMT methylation testing.
Tissue will be sent to [HOSPITAL]'s Hospital, [CITY], for 1p/19q and EGFR FISH.

Block for potential treatment trial: 
Tumour including the more proliferative nodules is best seen in block [IDNUM]. 

COMMENT
The findings would favour glioblastoma. Focal oligodendroglial features are seen. 1p/19q and EGFR FISH will be performed to exclude possible anaplastic oligodendroglioma and small cell glioblastoma.
DIAGNOSIS:
A&B. Left insular intra-axial brain tumour: High grade glioma, favour glioblastoma (WHO grade 4)

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE])

Report from [HOSPITAL]
Reported by Dr [DOCTOR], [DATE]
Accession: S014-16751

MATERIAL RECEIVED:
Slides: x6 ([IDNUM] [IDNUM]). Left insular intra-axial brain tumour.? GBM
CLINICAL DETAILS:
High grade glioma, favour glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). FISH analysis for 1p/19q LOH performed at request of Dr [DOCTOR]. Cc Dr [DOCTOR].
RESULTS:
This case was analysed for 1p/19q LOH using Vysis dual colour probe sets LSI 1p36/LSI 1q25 and LSI 19q13/19p13. Cut-offvalues were adopted from Smith et al. 2000 (J Clin Oncol:18;636-645) who defined a 1p/1q ratio of <0.85 and a 19q/19p ratio of <0.9 as indicating LOH. The case was also hybridised with Vysis LSI EGFR/Cep7 dual colour probe pair to assesswhether amplification of EGFR was present.
Chromosome 1
Mean copies 1p per cell: 1.6
Mean copies 1q per cell: 1.55
1p/1q ratio: 1.03
Interpretation: No 1p loss identified
Chromosome 19
Mean copies 19q per cell: 1.9
Mean copies 19p per cell: 1.9
19q/19p ratio: 1.0
Interpretation: No 19q loss identified
EGFR:
Mean copies of EGFR per cell: 3.6
Mean copies cep7 per cell: 3.5
EGFR/cep7 ratio: 1.03
Interpretation: No EGFR amplification present
CONCLUSION: Negative for both 1p/19 loss and EGFR amplification.



ADDITIONAL REPORT ([DATE])
Tissue was sent to Dr [DOCTOR], [HOSPITAL] Cancer Centre for MGMT methylation testing:

"DNA was extracted from paraffin tissue from Arnold Kur ([IDNUM]). 
The DNA was bisulphite modified and subjected to pyrosequencing to amplify a region of the MGMTpromoter in order to detect methylation. 
The sample was tested twice with the appropriate controls and was found to be methylated (55%) atthe MGMT promoter region."
