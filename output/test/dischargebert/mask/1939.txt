CLINICAL:
Forearm sarcoma resection.
Further clinical history taken from referral letters and previous pathology reports.
[AGE]year old female with history of recurrent pleomorphic high grade sarcoma of the left forearm recently treated with radiotherapy. 
Mastectomy for breast cancer in [DATE] with axillary recurrence in [DATE].
Very distant past history of a tumour in her left lower leg treated by surgery and radiotherapy. 
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Tumour left arm short stitch superior, medium ulnar, long radial", consists of an irregular piece of skin with underlying soft tissue and muscle.  The specimen has three sutures for orientation: short suture marking the superior margin (taken as 12 o'clock); long suture marking the radial margin (taken as 3 o'clock) and a medium suture marking the ulnar margin (taken as 9 o'clock). Specimen measures 125mm (12-6 o'clock), 90mm from (3-9 o'clock) and 25mm in thickness.  On the surface of the skin there is an irregular elevated skin coloured lesion measuring 35 x 45mm and a pale area ?scar.  On sectioning there are multiple cystic spaces filled with necrotic and haemorrhagic material in an area measuring  70 x 60mm.  Representative sections are taken according to the attached diagram. 
Block 1- 12 o'clock margin; 2- 6 o'clock margin; 3-7 - composite full TS  lesion from 3-9 o'clock; 8-11 - composite full TS lesion from 3-9 o'clock; 12-15 - composite TS lesion from 3-9 o'clock; 16-18 - representative sections of tumour. 
B.  Specimen labelled "Re-excision of ulnar margin stitch at new margin", consists of a strip of skin with subcutaneous tissue and one suture for orientation marking the new margin. It measures 110 x 15 x 5mm. The surface of the skin is unremarkable. The new margin is inked black, the opposite margin blue. The cut surface is unremarkable.  Fifteen representative sections in 4 blocks (approximately 80% of the specimen embedded).  Please see attached diagram.  (TO: [DOCTOR]/ec   [DATE])  
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]) 
A. Sections are of skin including subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle and show multiple foci of residual high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma which is present within the subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle. The sarcoma is composed of large pleomorphic bizarre cells as well as epithelioid and spindle cells. The tumour cells have high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, pleomorphic nuclei with coarse, clumped chromatin and prominent cherry red nucleoli. There are frequent multinucleated pleomorphic cells with intra-nuclear inclusions and scattered atypical mitoses are also identified. The surrounding subcutaneous tissue and skeletal muscle shows extensive radiation effect.
Immunohistochemistry:
Positive stain: Vimentin. 
Very mild focal positivity with CD68, SMA, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2 and PANCK.
Negative stains: S100, Myogenin, CD31, CD34, D2-40, Desmin and HMB45.
Ki-67 proliferation index is about 25 to 40%.
Margins:
Deep margin: 0.6mm (Block: [IDNUM])
Ulnar margin: 0.6mm (Block: [IDNUM])
Remaining margins (radial, superior and inferior): Clearof sarcoma.
 

COMMENT: 
Current tumour has been compared to the previous Fine Needle Biopsy ([DEPARTMENT] Pathology [IDNUM] (1)) and previous pathology reports ([DEPARTMENT] 20-SD-13-0003732 and [DEPARTMENT] (41333-14SK)).  The current specimen has the same histological appearances.  The histological and immunohistochemical features are consistent with residual/recurrent high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.  
B. Sections are of skin to subcutaneous tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
Representative sections have been seen by Dr [DOCTOR] who concurs. 

DIAGNOSIS:
A. Left arm: 
Residual/recurrent undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.
Sarcoma close to deep and ulnar margins. 

B. Re-excision of ulnar margin: No evidence of malignancy.
