Old endometriosis.  TAH BSO.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 70g.  The uterus measures 70 x 40 x 30mm.  The cervix has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 30mm and has an unremarkable surface.  On sectioning the endometrium is 2mm and myometrium is 14mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains foci of adenomyosis.  Also three fibroids are identified 5mm each in maximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 45mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  The right ovary measures 25 x 13 x 8mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fimbrial end measures 40mm in length and 10mm in diameter.  The left ovary measures 22 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.
Blocks: 1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 7 - representative section of leiomyoma; 8 - right fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 9 & 10 -right ovary; 11 - left fallopian tube and fimbrial end; 12 & 13 - left ovary.  
B.  Specimen labelled "Left uterosacral ligament" consists of a piece of fibrous tissue measuring 10 x 10 x 7mm.  The specimen TAE 1 block.  
C.  Specimen labelled "Left sidewall peritoneum" consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue measuring 20 x 10 x 7mm.  Serially transversely sectioned and AE 1 block.
(TO: [DOCTOR]  [DOCTOR]/mm [DATE]) 
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR])
A. Sections of the uterus show inactive endometrium with cystic atrophy. The cervix shows no significant abnormality. The myometrium shows benign leiomyoma(s) and adenomyosis. Sections of the ovaries show focal endometriosis. The bilateral fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
B & C.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue containing scattered foci of endometriosis. There is no evidence of malignancy. 
Representative slides seen with Dr [DOCTOR].


DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries: Inactive endometrium with cystic atrophy, adenomyosis, leiomyoma(s) and bilateral ovarian endometriosis. 

B & C.  Left uterosacral ligament and sidewall peritoneum: Endometriosis.
