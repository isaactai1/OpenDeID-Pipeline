MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A & B.  Sections show meningothelial meningioma (WHO, grade 1).  The tumour shows classical meningothelial architecture forming small lobules separated by fibrous/collagenous septae.  The tumour cells are uniform with oval nuclei with delicate chromatin and typical intranuclear inclusions.  Cellular whorls are present.  There is no significant cytological atypia.  No mitoses are seen.  The tumour cells are positive for EMA and Vimentin.  The stains for MNF-116 (pan-cytokeratin) and S-100 are negative.  The Ki-67 proliferation index is less than 1%.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
The case is shown to Dr [DOCTOR].
DIAGNOSIS:
A & B.  Transnasal sphenoid lesion - Meningioma (WHO grade 1).
