MICROSCOPIC:  ([DOCTOR])
A.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue in which there are multiple cystically dilated spaces lined by multinucleated histiocytes and macrophages in keeping with foreign body reaction. Changes of fat necrosis are identified. Focally, deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma showing extensive necrosis in keeping with colorectal origin are noted surrounded by fibrous scarring. A segment of vas deferens is identified.
