CLINICAL:
Endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Hypertension.  Asthma.Osteopenia.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries weighing 74g in total.  The uterus measures 65 x 50 x 32mm and has a smooth shiny serosal surface.  The ectocervix measures 30 x 25mm. There is no obvioustumour on the endometrium.  At the posterior right cornu the endometrium appears slightly roughened over 15 x 10mm ?tumour.  There is also another roughened area at the left lower uterine segment over 5 x 5mm.  On sectioning the endometrium is 1mm in thickness and the myometrium is 12mm in thickness.  The myometrium contains two fibroids ranging from 5 to 8mm inmaximum dimension.  The right fallopian tube measures 40 x 8 x 8mm.  The right ovary measures 20 x 14 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length x 8 x 5mm in maximum dimension.  The left ovary measures 26 x 15 x 10mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The endometrium is AE.
Blocks:  1 to 2 - full LS of anterior body and cervix; 3 to 4 - anterior left endometrium; 5 - anterior right endometrium; 6to 8 - full LS of posterior body and cervix; 9 to 11 - posterior right endometrium; 12 to 14 - posterior left endometrium; 15 - right fallopian tube; 16 - right ovary; 17 - left fallopian tube; 18 - left ovary.  Please see diagram.  (TO: [DOCTOR]; [DOCTOR]/rt [DATE])
MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR])
Sections show a Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded and cribriform glands with minimal intervening stroma lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGA architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). The carcinoma invades 7mm into a uterine wall 13mm thick. There is discontinuous endocervical and ectocervical stromal involvement by carcinoma, a focus of which is 1.1mm from the vaginal margin (6). No convincing lymphovascular space invasion or uterine serosal involvement is seen. The non-neoplastic endometrium appears atrophic. There are scattered benign leiomyomas and focal adenomyosis. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.
Representative slides seen with Dr [DOCTOR].
DIAGNOSIS:
Uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries: 
FIGO Grade 1 endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Carcinoma is 1.1mm from the vaginal margin.
Uterine leiomyomas and adenomyosis.
