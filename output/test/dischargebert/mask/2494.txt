CLINICAL:
Left hemicolectomy - splenic flexure tumour.  No evidence of metastases/perforation.  HTN, NIDDM.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Lefthemicolectomy for a splenic flexure tumour", consists of a hemicolectomy measuring 210mm in length.  85mm from the nearest resection margin there is a pedunculated and partly sessile tumour measuring 30 x 28mm which occupies approximately 60% of the circumference of the bowel.  The cut surface reveals a cream tumour which invades into the muscularis propria and focally through it into the mesenteric fat.  17mmfrom one resection margin 30mm from the tumour there is a pedunculated 6mm polyp.  Two further polyps are identified measuring 4 and 3mm which are well clear of the resection margins.  Numerous lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat.  
Blocks: 1 - resection margins; 2 to 5 - representative tumour; 6 - one polyp bisected; 7 - one polyp bisected; 8 - one polyp; 9 - apical node; 10 to 13 - lymph nodes; 14 - one node bisected;  15 & 16 - further lymph nodes.  ([DOCTOR]/vo [DATE])  
MICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr [DOCTOR] & registrar Dr [DOCTOR]):
Sections show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with the following features:
Macroscopic Description:

Site of tumour:  Splenic flexure	
Maximum tumour diameter:  30mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  85mm
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description:

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  13
Number of lymphnodes involved:  0	
pN0	No regional LN metastasis
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
Three (3) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia are present in the specimen
Residual tumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
