CLINICAL:
Obstructing right colonic tumour.  Hypothyroidism.  
Additional information supplied:  Patient has liver metastases.
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right hemicolectomy", consists of a right hemicolectomy and adherent omentum.  The terminal ileum measures 50mm in length x 55mm in open diameter. The caecum to ascending colon measures 205mm in length.  The caecum and ascending colon is dilated up to 150mm in open diameter with an attenuated wall and loss of mucosal folds. There is a circumferential tumour measuring approximately 30 x 30 x 15mm with adherent mesocolon along the serosal surface. Tumour is seen on the serosal surface of the bowel, but there is no perforation present.  Distal to the tumour the bowel appears unremarkable.  The tumour is 60mm from the distal surgical margin and approximately 130mm from the proximal surgical margin inked blue.  The bowel mucosa is otherwise unremarkable.  Nopolyps or other lesions are found.  There is a segment of attached adherent omentum measuring 170 x 50 x 30mm.  Firm deposits of tumour are found within the omentum ranging from 5-12mm in maximum dimension.  Lymph nodes are found within the mesocolon.
Block 1 - distal surgical margin; 2- proximal surgical margin; 3 & 4, 5, 6, 7 - tumour with area of deepest invasion; 8 - representative normal bowel; 9 & 10 - apical lymph node with adjacent deposit of tumour next to lymph node; 11-16 - lymph nodes (11 - one lymph node bisected; 12 - one lymph node bisected; 13 - one lymph node bisected; 14 - one lymph node bisected; 15 & 16 - lymph nodes as seen); 17-19 - representative nodules of tumour within omentum; 20 - tumourfor biobank.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr [DOCTOR]): 
Sections show adenocarcinoma of the ascending colon, which breeches the serosal surface.  Separate deposits of tumour are seen within the omentum.  The features are as follows: 
Macroscopic Description

Site of tumour:  Ascending colon.
Maximum tumour diameter:   30mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  60mm (distal)
Tumour perforation:  No
Microscopic Description

Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate to poor.
Local invasion
pT4a  	Tumour penetrates the surface of the visceral peritoneum.
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends:  Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  14
Number of lymph nodes involved:  1
pN1a  	Metastases in 1 regional LN
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pM1  	Distant metastasis confirmed	Site: Omentum
Background abnormalities/other comments:  Nil.
Residual tumour status
R0  	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status
MLH1  		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2 		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2  	Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6  	Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinomafor MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.

ADDENDUM ([DATE]):
Report from [HOSPITAL] Hospital:
Reported by:  Prof. [DOCTOR]:
MUTATION ANALYSIS IN DNA EXTRACTED FROM TUMOUR

RESULTS:  NO TARGECTED EGFR, KRAS, OR NRAS MUTATIONDETECTED, BRAF V600E MUTATION DETECTED
Gene                                                           BRAF
Location in gene                                         exon 15
Nucleotide change in coding DNA              c.1799T>A
Predicted amino acid change in proteinp.VAal600Glu
COSMIC Database ID                                 476
Alternative nomenclature                             V600E

THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATION:  Tumours lacking mutations in KRAS or NRAS exons 2, 3 or 4 are more likely to respond to anti-EGFR antibody therapy (Douillard et al NEJM 2013; 369:1023-34).  The significance of BRAF V600E mutation as a predictive marker for antiEFGR therapy in colorectal carcinoma is controversial.  
SUMMARY:
NO TARGETED EGFR,KRAS, OR NRAS MUTATION DETECTED
BRAFV600E MUTATION DETECTED.
