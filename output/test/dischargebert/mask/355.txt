MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of a multicystic and solid ovary measuring 65 x 55 x 40mm with a tube measuring 55mm long and attached fat 55 x 50mm.  On sectioning there are broad oedematous papillae which line most of the cystic spaces.  At one pole of the cyst, the wall is thin but is encased by the attached fat.  No deposits or lymph nodes are identified in the fat.  
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 7 - representative cyst wall; 8 & 9 - representative fallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign serous cystadenofibroma.
Phone result by Dr [DOCTOR] to Dr [DOCTOR] at 9.50am and [DATE].
B.  Specimen labelled "Left tube and ovary" consists of a unilocular cyst measuring 70 x 55 x 40mm with an attached fallopian tube which is 45mm long and attached fat.  The inner lining is covered by broad papillae over approximately 60% of the cyst surface.  The cyst is filled with haemorrhagic fluid.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section 1; 2 - frozen section 2; 3 to 6 - representative cyst wall; 7 & 8 - representative fallopian tube.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Benign serous cystadenoma.
Phone result by Dr [DOCTOR] to Dr [DOCTOR] at 9.50am and [DATE].

D.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of omentum received in two pieces measuring 310 x 200 x 20mm in aggregate.  No tumour deposits are identified.  Representative sections in three blocks.   ([DOCTOR]/cc [DATE])
 
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]): 
A & B.  Sections show benign serous cystadenomas of the ovaries.  The fallopian tubes show no significant abnormality.  
C.  Sections show benign mesothelial inclusion cysts containing partly calcified material.  There is no evidence of malignancy. 
D.   Sections of omentum show no significant abnormality. There is no evidence of malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:  
A.   Right tube and ovary:  Benign serous cystadenoma. 
B.   Left tube and ovary:  Benign serous cystadenoma.
C.   Caecal nodule:  Benign mesothelial cysts.
D.   Omentum:  No significant abnormality.
