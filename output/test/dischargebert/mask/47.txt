Pelvic mass.  Past history of breast cancer.  Large left ovarian mass.  Hysterectomy.  Asthma.  Hypertension.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Left tube + ovary" consists of an ovary measuring 40 x 35 x 18mm with an adjacent fallopian tube measuring 40 x 3 x 3mm.  On sectioning the ovary is multicystic and contains clear fluid.  There is no tumour present.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section; 2 to 5- representative ovarian section (block 2 - TS of fallopian tube).  Multiple pieces in 5 blocks.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Adenofibroma.
Result to anaesthetist by Dr [DOCTOR] at 9:40am on the 3rd of December 2013.
B.  Specimen labelled "Right tube and ovary" consists of large cystic ovary measuring 135 x 90 x 75mm plus fallopian tube measuring 60 x 3 x 3mm.  The ovary weighs 416g.  The ovary is multicystic and some cystshave a papillary surface.
Blocks:1 - frozen section; 2 to 13 - representative section (block 2 - TS of fallopian tube).  Multiple pieces in 13 blocks.
C.  Specimen labelled "Sigmoid fat" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 8 x 10 x3mm.  AE 1 block.
D.  Specimen labelled "Retroperitoneum" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 8 x 4 x 2mm.  AE 1 block.
E.  Specimen labelled "Right paracolic gutter" consists of a piece of fatty tissue measuring 15 x 6 x 3mm.  AE 1 block.
F.  Specimen labelled "Omentum" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 200 x 80 x 20mm.  Serosal surface and cut surface unremarkable.

C.  Sections show normal appearing adipose tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
D & E.  Sections show normal appearing fibrofatty tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
F.  Sections show normal appearing omental tissue with no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.
