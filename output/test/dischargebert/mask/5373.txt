SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE]):

CLINICAL:
Recurrent granulosa cell tumour.  COPD hypothyroidism.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right cul de sac peritoneum", consists oftwo tan and red pieces of solid tissue 7 x 4 x 2mm and 5 x 1 x 1mm.  AE 1 block.
B.  Specimen labelled "Recto sigmoid nodule", consists of an unoriented nodular piece of solid tissue 35 x 30 x 18mm.  The nodule is disrupted over a broad front.  The external surface is inked green.  The cut surfaces are pale yellow and friable.  
Blocks: 1 to 4 - RS (block 4 reserved block).  (TO: [DOCTOR];[DOCTOR]/vo [DATE])  Re-select - 5 to 8 - area of staple line (inked blue); [DOCTOR] [DATE].
MICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A.  Sections show mesothelium underlying fibrous tissue.  There is some reactive mesothelial  proliferation and haemosiderin deposition.  Also present are cells with atypical nuclei and a variable amount of pale cytoplasm, arranged in groups.  These cells stain inhibin and oestrogen receptor positive.  The features are consistent with poorly differentiated granulosa cell tumour.   
B.  Sections show a tumour nodule.  The tumour consists ofsheets, strands and trabeculae of cells within a partly loose and myxoid stroma.  The tumour cells have medium sized and large nuclei with very fine chromatin, and generally scant cytoplasm.  Some nuclei have a single nucleolus.  Nuclei are irregular in shape and numerous cells with nuclear groves are identified.  No definite tubules or rosettes are seen.  Mitoses are infrequent.  The appearances are consistent with a poorly differentiated granulosacell tumour.   
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Right cul de sac peritoneum:   Poorly differentiated granulosa cell tumour.
B.  Recto sigmoid nodule:  Poorly differentiated granulosa cell tumour.  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE]):
B.  This casewas discussed at the Gynae Tumour Board Meeting on [DATE].  It was pointed out that there was a staple line on the specimen, where the tumour was removed from the bowel wall.
The specimen has been re-examined and a staple line 40mm long was identified.  Further sections have been taken.  
No muscularis propria or other layers of the large bowel wall are identified in sections from the staple line.  Tumour extends to the staple line and is assumed to extend to themargin in this region.
Immunostains for hormone receptors have also been performed as requested.
Oestrogen receptor:  To be repeated.  A further supplementary report will be issued.
Progesterone receptor:  Positive.% of tumour cells show positive staining.
                                  Predominant intensity of staining:  Moderate.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE]):
Oestrogen receptor:   Positive.
                                  75% of tumour cells show positive staining.
                                   Predominant intensity of staining:  Moderate.
