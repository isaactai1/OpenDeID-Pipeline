Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - remaining tissue.  
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Tumour, possible neoplastic, type unknown.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A and B. Sections show a lesion composed of sheets of tumour cells with pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei and prominent nucleoli.  Some of the tumour cells present have eccentric clock-faced nuclei, in keeping with plasma cell differentiation.
The tumour cells are positive for CD138. There is kappa light chain restriction on kappa/lambda staining.
The findings are in keeping with a plasmacytoma/multiple myeloma.
