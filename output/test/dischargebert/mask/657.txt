SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE]):


CLINICAL:
Right thalamic lesion - ?met ?glioma.  Poor nutrition and fluid intake post op, family concerned and requested review.
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right thalamic lesion" consists of six tan/pink fragments from 1 to 6mm in maximum dimension.  Two smearsand 3/4 of the remainder in one block for frozen section.  Note by [DOCTOR]/[DOCTOR] on the [DATE] at 11:12am.
Blocks:  1 - frozen section; 2 - the remainder, AE.
FROZEN SECTION REPORT:
Favour high grade glioma.
Result to Dr [DOCTOR] by Dr [DOCTOR]/[DOCTOR]/[DOCTOR] at 11:27 am on the [DATE]
B.  Specimen labelled "Right thalamic lesion" consists of six fragments ranging from 2 to 7mm in maximum dimension.  AE 1 block.  (TO: [DOCTOR]; [DOCTOR]/rt [DATE])
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A, B.  Sections show pieces of tumour tissue.  The tumour is cellular and consists of sheets of cells with large, hyperchromatic atypical nuclei and a variable amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm with poorly defined cell borders.  Mitoses are identified and there is palisaded tumour necrosis.  There is also some microvascular proliferation.  No normalbrain tissue is seen.  The appearances are of glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).  
Immunohistochemical stains:
GFAP:  Positive. 
p53:  Positive.  Around 50% of tumour cells show positive nuclear staining.  
IDH1:  Negative.  
Ki-67:  To follow.
Molecular tests:
Tissue will be forwarded to Dr [DOCTOR], [HOSPITAL] Centre, for MGMT testing and a supplementary report issued.  

Block for potential treatment trial (if required):  
Viable tumour with less procedural artefact is best seen in block [IDNUM].  
DIAGNOSIS:
Right thalamic tumour:  Glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).  
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT ([DATE]):
Ki-67:  High proliferation index.  Around 50% of tumour cells show positive staining.
