CLINICAL:
R breast cancer - axillary SLN's (subcut mastectomy).
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right breast axillary sentinel lymph node" consists of fatty tissue 30 x 15 x 5mm containing lymph nodes 4 to 6mm.  Imprint from each for cytology.  Note by [DOCTOR].
Blocks:  1 to 4 - each one lymph node.
IMPRINT CYTOLOGY REPORT:
Four negative nodes.
Result to anaesthetist by Dr [DOCTOR] at 10:40 on the [DATE].
B.  Specimen labelled "Right breast stitch at axillary tail" consists of a mastectomy specimen with a stitch marking lateral end measuring 150 (lateral to medial) x 140 (superior to inferior) x 45mm (superficial to deep).  The overlying skin measures 60 x 30mm and shows no abnormality.  The nipple is prominent and 12mm in maximum dimension.  The superficial margin is inked blue and deep margin is inked black.  At 1 o'clock 60mm from the nipple there is a 14 x 7 x 7mm indurated pale solid tumour.  The tumour is 5mm fromdeep, 22mm from superficial, 35mm from superior, 95mm from inferior, 38mm from medial and 95mm from lateral margins.  No other distinct nodules are identified.
Blocks:  1 - tumour and deep margin; 2 - tumour, reserved block; 3 & 4 - paired sections, tumour and superficial margin (superficial margin in block 4); 5 - section of nipple; 6 - tissue behind nipple; 7 & 8 - random sections upper outer quadrant; 9 & 10 - random sections lower outer quadrant; 11 & 12 - random sections lower inner quadrant; 13 & 14 - random sections upper inner quadrant.
