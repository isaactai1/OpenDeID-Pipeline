CLINICAL:
Caecal cancer.  
MACROSCOPIC:
Specimen labelled "Right colon" consists of a right hemicolectomy comprising of a segment ofterminal ileum measuring 30mm in length, in continuity with caecum and ascending colon measuring 140mm in length with an open circumference of 80mm at the caecum.  Arising from the caecal mucosa and extending towards the ileocaecal valve, there is an exophytic fungating tan tumour measuring 60 x 50mm. The tumour is 30mm from the proximal resection margin. The cut surface shows full thickness bowel wall involvement with macroscopic evidence of tumour extension into the pericolic fat.  The remainder of the bowel mucosa appears grossly normal.  The appendix is not identified.  Lymph nodes are identified ranging from 3 to 11mm across.
Blocks:  1- proximal margin; 2 - distal margin; 3 to 7 - tumour (block 7 - research block); 8 - tumour and ileal caecal valve; 9 - apical lymph node; 10 - four lymph nodes; 11 - small lymph nodes; 12 - four lymph nodes; 13 - one lymph node.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
	
Maximum tumour diameter:     60 mm
Distance of tumour to nearer cut end:  30mm (proximal)
Tumour perforation:     No
Type
Adenocarcinoma NOS
Differentiation by predominant area
Moderate
Local invasion
pT3	Beyond muscularis propria
Tumour involvement of margins
Cut ends: Not involved
Lymph nodes
Number of lymph nodes present:  12	
Number of lymph nodes involved:  0	
Lymphovascular invasion
Absent
Perineural invasion
Absent
Histologically confirmed distant metastases
pMX	Cannot be assessed histologically
Background abnormalities/other comments
The lesion is arising from a tubulovillous adenoma.
Residualtumour status
R0	No residual tumour
Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status	
MLH1		Preserved nuclear staining
PMS2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH2		Preserved nuclear staining
MSH6		Preserved nuclear staining
Comment:
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.
