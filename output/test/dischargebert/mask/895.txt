CLINICAL:
Multiple lung nodules, glucose avid on PET scan.  S/P colectomy for colon Ca [DATE], S/P melanoma resection.  Nodule left lower lobe, lesion left lower lobe tissue, nodule and margin left upper lobe.  
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Wedge resection left upper lobe" consists of a wedge of lung 55 x 30 x 28mm weighing 19.0g when fixed.  A firm cream well circumscribed nodule is identified which appears to come close to the pleural surface and the inked staple resection margin.  The nodule measures 15 x 14 x 12mm.  The remainder of the lung appears unremarkable. 
Blocks: 1 - nodule; 4 - uninvolved lung; 5 - reserve block.   
B.  Specimen labelled "Wedge resection L lower lobe" consists of a wedge of lung 40 x 30 x 18mm weighing 6.5g when fixed.  Around two sides a staple resection margin is in situ.  The cut surface reveals a firm cream heterogenous yellow/cream lesion taking up the majority of the specimen which comes close to the resection margin and the pleural surface measuring 22mm in maximum dimension.  AE 4 blocks.
   
C.  Specimen labelled "Lesion left lower lobe fissure" consists of a tan/cream/haemorrhagic piece of triangular tissue measuring 8mm in maximum dimension.   AE 1 block.(TO: [DOCTOR]; [DOCTOR]/ta  [DATE]) 
 
 
MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR] - [DATE])
A.  The 15mm nodule is a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows morphologic and immunohistochemical features (CAM5.2, CEA and CK20 positive; CK7, PSA and TTf-1 negative) consistent with colorectal origin. The carcinoma is present at the inked surgical margin but appears clear of the pleural surface. The adjacent non-neoplastic lung shows mild emphysematous change. 
B.  The 22mm nodule is a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma is similar in appearance to the left upper lobe nodule and would be consistent with primary colorectal origin. The carcinoma is 1.1mm from the inked surgical margin and abuts the pleural surface. The adjacent non-neoplastic lung shows focal alveolar collapse and mild emphysematous change.
C.  The left lower lobe fissure nodule is a lymph node showing anthrasilicosis with some adjacent pulmonary parenchyma. There is no evidence of malignancy (0/1). 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.  Left upper lobe (wedge resection): Metastaticadenocarcinoma, present at surgical margin.

B.  Left lower lobe (wedge resection): Metastatic adenocarcinoma, abuts pleural surface and is 1.1mm from the surgical margin. 

C.  Left lower lobe lesion: No evidence of malignancy in one lymph node (0/1). 


***SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT #1 ([DATE]): Dr [DOCTOR]
As requested by Dr [DOCTOR], the container for specimen A was reviewed, and an additional portion of stapled lung tissue was identified. The staples were removed and sections show pulmonary parenchyma with nosignificant histologic abnormality. 
Please correlate with clinical and operative findings.
