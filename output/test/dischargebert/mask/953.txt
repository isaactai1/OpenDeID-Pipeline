ADDENDUM REPORT [DATE]

CLINICAL:
Right renal tumour and large paracaval mass involving right colon.  
1.  R kidney + attached R colon.
2.  Paracaval lymph node.
3.  Distal paracaval lymph nodes. 
(Previous FNA and core biopsy - see [IDNUM]).
MACROSCOPIC:
A.  Specimen labelled "Right kidney and attached colon" consists of a kidney with attached perinephric fat and a section of colon.  The kidney measures 110 x 65 x 50mm.  There is a section of renal artery 30mm attached and there is a stump of ureter 15mm in length within the hilar tissue.  The cut surface of the kidney reveals a tan/golden/necrotic tumour measuring 28 x 25 x 22mm.  The tumour abuts the renal capsule and focally is seen to push the renal capsule into the perinephric fat.  The tumour appears to come within 2mm of this perinephric fat resection margin.  The tumour is 30mm from the hilar resection margin.  In the area where the tumour appears to push into the perinephric fat there is an area of fibrous/fat necrosis area within the perirenal fat which is adherent to a section of colon measuring 95mm in length.  No definite tumour is identified within this fibrous adherence.  The remainder of the renal parenchyma also appears unremarkable.  Multiple lymphnodes are identified within the mesenteric fat measuring from 2 to 5mm.  A further area of yellow/cream area is identified within the colonic mesenteric fat measuring 15 x 10 x 10mm ? fat necrosis.  In the same area there is a possible area of diverticulum within the colonic mucosa.  
Blocks: 1 - ?ureteric margin; 2 - ?artery margin; 3 - other vascular margins; 4 to 8 - tumour to point of capsular invasion; 9 to 14 - representative areas of tumour to areas of fibrous adhesion; 15 & 16 - uninvolved kidney; 17 - colonic resection margins; 18 & 19 - pericolic lymph nodes; 20 - yellow area within mesentery; 21 & 22 - ?area of diverticulum; 23 - reserve block.
  
B.  Specimen labelled "Paracaval lymph node" consists of a piece of tan tissue measuring 80 x 75 x 40mm which has some fibrofatty tissue attached around the surface.  The cut surface reveals a multinodular tan/haemorrhagic golden tumour taking up the entire specimen.  Representative sections6 blocks.  Block [IDNUM] is reserve block.
C.  Specimen labelled "Distal caval lymph nodes" consists of a piece of fatty tissue 35mm in maximum dimension.  Multiple lymph nodesare identified from 2 to 12mm.  
Blocks: 1 - lymph nodes; 2 - one lymph node bisected.  ([DOCTOR]/ta [DATE]) 
 
   
MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr [DOCTOR]):
A.   Sections show a grade 3 papillary renal cell carcinoma with nucleoli easily identified (x10 objective). The tumour measures 28 x 25 x 22mm and is classified as a type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (the tumour cells have eosinophilic cytoplasm). There is no tumour necrosis.  The tumour invades through the renal capsuleinto perinephric fat and is focally present at the perinephric margin.  There is a fibrous adhesion between the tumour and the segment of colon and this dense fibrous adhesion contains scattered small tumour aggregates (T4 - beyond Gerota's fascia).  
The tumour does not invade the renal hilum or pelvicalyceal system and there is no abnormality of the renal vessels or proximal ureter.  The kidney away from the tumour appears normal and one small uninvolved perinephric lymph node is identified.
The segment of colon shows no abnormality and the five small mesenteric lymph nodes identified are free of tumour. There is a focus of fat necrosis and dense fibrosis within the mesentery which also contains an occasional tumour aggregate.  This focus within the mesentery is unrelated to the adhesion between the tumour and the colon.  
There is also organising haemorrhage within the perirenal fat consistent with a recent core/FNA. 
B.   The large paracaval mass has the appearance of metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma and there is a small amount of residual node at the periphery of the mass.  This mass shows focal perinodal infiltration.  
C.   Three (3) of the four (4) distal paracaval lymph nodes identified are partly or totally replaced by metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma.  (ec) 
DIAGNOSIS:
A.    Right nephrectomy and attached colon:  
-      Papillary renal cell carcinoma, type 2, Fuhrman grade 3, size 28 x 25 x 22mm.
-      Capsular invasion with perinephric infiltrationand tumour present within the 
       fibrous adhesion to the colon, positive perinephric margin.
-      Scarring and fat necrosis with metastatic tumour in colonic mesentery. 
        (T4 - beyond Gerota's fascia)
B.    Paracaval lymph node:
Large (80mm) metastasis of papillary renal cell carcinoma with perinodal 
infiltration. 
C.    Distal paracaval lymph nodes:
Metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma in three of four (3/4) lymph nodes, no perinodal spread. 
(N1 - regional nodal metastasis)
T4N1 Mx
